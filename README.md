The glint color for enchanted books has been changed to white in order to make the colors more visible.  

## CHANGING COLORS
If you don't like a particular color assigned to an enchantment, you can change it with the following command:  
```
/colorfulenchantments enchantment <enchantment> <red> <green> <blue>
```
In which &lt;red&gt; , &lt;green&gt; and &lt;blue&gt; are integer values in the range [0-255] that represent the components of the color (notice that you can obtain these components by searching "color picker" on google and selecting the color that you want).

## MORE ENCHANTMENTS IN A BOOK
More than one enchantments in a book are represented by adding more colored laces to the enchanted books.  
But, because of this method, it is not possible to visualize more than four enchantments in the item.
