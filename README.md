This mods solves all these <b><i>really serious</i></b> problems of enchanted books by introducing a unique book for every enchantment!  
It also works for <b>modded enchantments</b> which are assigned a random color (that can be changed).

Notice that, <b>only for enchanted books</b>, the glint color is changed to white to make colors more visible.

## CUSTOMIZING COLORS
If you don't like a particular color assigned to an enchantment, you can change it with the following command:  
```
/colorfulenchantments enchantment <enchantment> <red> <green> <blue>
```
In which <red>, <green> and <blue> are integer values in the range [0-255] that represent the components of the color.  
These components can be obtained by searching for "color picker" the browser and selecting the color that you want.  

## MORE ENCHANTMENTS IN A BOOK
More than one enchantments in a book are represented by adding <b>more colored laces</b> to the enchanted books.  
But, because of this method, <b>it is possible to visualize only the first four enchantments</b>.
