This mods solves all these <b><i>really serious</i></b> problems of enchanted books by introducing a unique book for every enchantment!  
It also works for <b>modded enchantments</b> which are assigned a random color (that can be changed).

Notice that, <b>only for enchanted books</b>, the glint color is changed to white to make colors more visible.

## CUSTOMIZING COLORS
If you don't like a particular color assigned to an enchantment, you can change it with the following command:  
```
/colorfulenchantments enchantment <enchantment> <red> <green> <blue>
```
In which <red>, <green> and <blue> are integer values in the range [0-255] that represent the components of the color.  
These components can be obtained by searching for "color picker" the browser and selecting the color that you want.  
  
Instead, you can use the following command if you want to change the color back to the default one (if present):  
```
/colorfulenchantments enchantment reset
```

## MORE ENCHANTMENTS IN A BOOK
More than one enchantments in a book are represented by adding <b>more colored laces</b> to the enchanted books.  
But, because of this method, <b>it is possible to visualize only the first four enchantments</b>.
